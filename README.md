# Day 06: Understanding the While Loop

Welcome to **Day 06** of my **100 Days of Python Challenge**!  
Today, I focused on learning the **While Loop** in Python.

## üìù Learning Objectives

The goal for today was to understand how the `while` loop works in Python. The `while` loop is used to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is `True`. Once the condition becomes `False`, the loop stops.

### Key Points Learned:
1. Basic Syntax:  
A simple 'while' loop is structured as follows:
2. Condition Control:
The loop continues to run as long as the condition evaluates to True.
The loop will stop when the condition becomes False.
3. Breaking out of the Loop:
You can use break to exit the loop before the condition becomes False.
4. Avoiding Infinite Loops:
It's important to ensure the condition eventually becomes False, or the loop may run indefinitely, leading to an infinite loop.
